	<h2 style="color: white;">About JBCE (Born Philippines on April 3, 2002)</h2>
	<br>
	<div>
	<p class="aboutwebsite">Hi, I'm JB Charelle B. Eglesia From Philippines.<br>
	My dream is to become a professional artist.<br><br>

	I had been watching many artist youtuber that paint and sketch,i  always<br>
	watch tutorials in youtube to learn how to draw and finally i started to
	draw five years ago. <br><br>
	I started in freehand, and now i used grid line on my artwork. <br>
	I also study other art style like inverted, digital
	painting, tape art, colored pencil drawing,pastel drawing and charcoal and 
	graphite drawing. <br>

	Currently, I am studying realistic drawing using charcoal and graphite. <br><br>
	I created this website to inspire people to see the joy in life and to turn your creative mind off…in order to make you more creative. <br><br>My art is for you.  <br>Exploring new types of art and mediums is so important, both as an artist and as a viewer. <br>Painting, drawing and making things with my hands has always been a huge part of who I am. It’s where we all come from; we’re creative creatures.<br>So I’m on a mission to help others tap into and share their creativity. I love to share art ideas that inspire creativity and give you an outlet for <br>self-expression. If you enjoy exploring my website, follow my artpage and subscribe on my other site for more ideas and inspiration. Thanks so much!
	<br><br>
	I am open for art commission.<br>
	If you are interested message me on my social media account or contact me.</p>
